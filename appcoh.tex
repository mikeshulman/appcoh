Homotopy type theory (HoTT) is an expression of a style of
mathematics that expands the notion of ``identity'' to
include logical identity, homotopy equivalence, and path
connectedness.  Experts call this style \emph{Univalence
  foundations}. And as foundations, there is an ambitious
program to encode all of mathematics in homotopy type
theory. There is a growning community working to realize
these ambitions and this paper belongs to this group.

Our present goal is to bring the classical theory of
algebraic topology into the fray, and in particular the
Borsuk-Ulam theorem.  However, the HoTT approach to
algebraic topology comes with on immediate challenge: the
presence of so many fixed point theorems where, in the
course of a proof, the fixed point must be specified
precisely, not only up to homotopy.  What is the problem
with this?  It is that homotopy type theory only works up to
homotopy. Compare, for instance, the topological circle
$$ \SS^1 \bydef \left\{ (x,y) \in \RR^2 | x^2 + y^2 = 1
\right\} $$ with the homotopy type theoretical circle
defined by a pair of constructors $ \type{base} $ and
$ \type{loop} \tin \type{base} = \type{base}$. One has
infinitely many points that can be described exactly and the
other has a single point. Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem
illustrates this problem nicely. We provide its statement
and proof here for reference.

\begin{theorem}
  Let $ \DD^2 $ denote the topological disk $ \left\{ (x,y)
      \in \RR^2 | x^2 + y^2 \leq 1 \right\} $.  Any
  continuous map $ f \from \DD^2 \to \DD^2 $ has a fixed point.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose that $ f $ is continuous but does not have a fixed
  point, hence $ f(x) \neq x $ for all $ x \in \DD^2 $.
  For each $ x \in \DD^2 $, dray a ray from $ f(x) $ to $ x
  $. This ray intersects the circle in a point we denote by
  $ s(x) $. This defines a continuous function $ s \from
  \DD^2 \to \SS^1 $ with the property that $ s(x)=x $ for all $ x $ on
  the boundary of $ \DD^2 $.  That implies that the identity
  on $ \SS^1 $ factors as the inclusion $ \SS^1
  \hookrightarrow \DD^2 $ followed by $ s $.  Appying the
  fundamental group function $ \pi_1 $ to this factorization
  gives that the identity on $ \pi_1 \left( \SS^1 \right) =
  \ZZ $ factors through $ \pi_1 \left( \DD^2 \right) = 1 $
  which is absurd.
\end{proof}

Note how this proof relied on our precise specification of
the point $ s(x) $ on the circle.  This point cannot be
specified precisely in HoTT. Even if we did work with the
only homotopical point on the circle, that is with $ \S^1 $,
there is no way to relate $ \SS^1 $ to $ \S^1 $ inside of
type theory. Semantically speaking, this involves comparing
a topological space with $ \infty $-groupoids. This is done
using the fundamental $ \infty $-groupiod construction.  No
such construction exists in HoTT. This is the problem that
real-cohesive homotopy theory solves. It does so by
proposing to combine two already existing, but previously
unrelated, type semantics: topological and
$ \infty $-groupoidal. With this proposal, there are three
puzzles to be solved.

\begin{enumerate}
\item We need to define a model for a \emph{topological $ \infty
    $-groupoid}.
\item What rules or axioms can we equip HoTT with so that we
  can compare, for example, $ \SS^1 $ to $ \S^1 $.
\item Topology is incompatible with the law of the excluded
  middle, which is required to prove these classic fixed
  point theorems. How can we resolve this?
\end{enumerate}

Shulman's original paper on real-cohesive HoTT
\cite{shul:bfp} discusses the solution to these puzzles in
detail. Presently, we are content to simply say that the
Lawvere's theory of cohesion offers a solution. Of course,
we need to adapt cohesion to homotopy type theory and we
leave the description of this to Shulman, but we do provide
a high-level description of the role that cohesion plays.

A \emph{category of cohesive space} is a pair of categories
equipped with a string of adjunctions
\[
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep = 25pt]
  \cat{Spaces}
    \arrow[d, shift left = 1em, "f_\ast"']
    \arrow[d, shift right = 3em, "f_!"'] \\
  \cat{Sets}
    \arrow[u, shift left = 1em, "f^\ast"]
    \arrow[u, shift right = 3em, "f^!"] 
\end{tikzcd} 
\]
with $ f_! \dashv f^\ast \dashv f_\ast \dashv f^! $ and such
that $ f_! $ preserves finite products.  As Lawvere puts it,
the objects of $ \cat{Sets} $ should be thought of as
\emph{abstract sets} which
\begin{quote}
  ... may by conceived of as a bag of dots which are devoid
  of properties apart from mutual distinctness \cite{lawvere:cohesive}.
\end{quote}
On the other hand, the objects of $ \cat{Spaces} $ should be
thought of as abstract sets together with a sort of
\emph{cohesion} between the ``dots''. For our purposes, we
think of cohesion as a topology though, in reality, this
definition above axiomatizes the various forms that cohesion
may take, each functor playing a different role.  The
$ f_! $ functor tells us which points are ``stuck'' together
through the cohesion by returning a set of connected
components. The $ f^\ast $ functor endows a set with the
discrete topology. The $ f_\ast $ functor forgets the
topology of a space. The $ f^! $ functor endows a set with
the codiscrete topology on a set.  From this string of
adjoints, we get another adjoint string
$ \int \dashv \flat \dashv \sharp $ on $ \cat{Spaces} $
comprised of the \defn{shape operation}
$ \int \bydef f^\ast f_! $, the \defn{flat operation}
$ \flat \bydef f^\ast f_\ast $, and the \defn{sharp operation}
$ \sharp \bydef f^! f_\ast $.

To see how the axiomatic cohesion addresses the above
puzzles, we will speak in the language of sets and
categories instead of type theory. In other words, we
restrict out attention to the semantics of the relevant type
theory.

To solve the first puzzle, constructing a topological
$ \infty $-groupoid, we ask first that $ \cat{Spaces} $ and
$ \cat{Sets} $ are toposes. A cohesive topos is also a
\emph{local and locally connected topos} which can be
constructed using sheaves on a site that satisfy certain
properties. By expanding this construction to the
$ (\infty,1) $-category, we can obtain cohesive
$ (\infty,1) $-toposes using $ \infty $-sheaves on a site as
shown by Schreiber \cite{schreib:diff}.  The objects of a
resulting cohesive $ (\infty,1) $-topos are precisely the
topological groupoids we seek.

The second puzzle involves comparing a space with its
homotopy type.  Again modifying axiomatic cohesion, we
replace the categories $ \cat{Sets} $ and $ \cat{Spaces} $
with the $ (\infty,1) $-categories of $ \cat{Spaces} $ and $
\infty-\cat{Groupoids} $. We also replace the functors with
$ \infty $-functors.  The validity of this rests on work by
Schreiber \cite{schreib:diff}. In this setup, applying $
\shape $ to a space returns the fundamental $ \infty
$-groupoid, an excellent proxy for the homotopy type.  

Axiomatic cohesion also provides a solution to the final
puzzle: the failure of the \emph{continuous} excluded
middle. Given that we are working with topological objects,
we require that excluded middle holds continuously, but in
general it does not. Given a space $ X $ and subspace $ U $,
there is no continuous inverse to the inclusion
$ U + (X \setminus U) \to X $ because, even though the
underlying sets are the same, the topologies are
different. If we can introduce discontinuous functions
$ X \to U + (X \setminus U) $, then we can find a
discontinuous inverse to the inclusion, therefore obtaining
a modified, ``discontinuous'' law of the excluded
middle. Hence, the existence of a law of the excluded middle
in our context hinges on the introduction of such
discontinuous functions. To this end, recall that $ \flat $
retopolozes discretely and $ \sharp $ retopologizes
codiscretely. If $ \hom (X,Y) $ is the space of continous
functions from $ X $ to $ Y $, then both $ \hom (\flat X,Y)
$ and $ \hom (X,\sharp Y) $ contain the discontinuous, by
which we mean not necessarily continuous, functions from $ X
$ to $ Y $.  

Moving towards syntax means introducing into homotopy type
theory the constructors that mirror the semantics of $ \int $,
$ \flat $, and $ \sharp $. Upon adding these constructors,
we obtain \emph{cohesive homotopy type theory}. The ``real''
part of name comes from an additional axiom included so that
we can capture the topology syntactically using continuous
paths from the reals. This axiom states
\begin{center}
\begin{quotation}
  A crisp type $ \type{A} $ is discrete if and only if the
  function that returns a constant path
  $ \type{A} \to (\RR \to \type{A}) $ is an equivalence.
\end{quotation}
\end{center}
Calling $ \type{A} $ a crisp variable means that we
perform constructions on it without regarding the topology,
such as defining maps $ \flat\type{A} \to \type{Y} $ or $
\type{X}\to\sharp\type{A} $.  When including this axiom
along with the syntactic versions of shape, flat, and sharp,
we get \emph{real-cohesive homotopy type theory}.

  Define n-disks as both sets and types, the latter which is
  simply 1, since they're contractible. Show that $ \shape
  \DD = \D $
\item
  Define n-spheres as sets.  Use pushouts to glue

\subsection{Defining $\set{RP}^n$}
We define $\set{RP}^n$ using push outs, tautological bundles, spheres, and an inductive process, following the work of Rijike [].

$\set{RP}^1$ is defined as the following push out, where $a_1(-1,x) = \frac{x}{4}$ and $a_1(1,x)= \frac{x}{4} + \frac{3}{4}$, and $b_1 (\pm 1, x) := (0, a(\pm1, x))$.\\

\{0 \} \times \set{I} \arrow[r] & \set{RP}^1
\end{tikzcd}
\]
%%% show that shape of RP1 is S1.. start reading pg 63 of brouwer fixed pt paper%%
Let$\U_{\set{R}}$ be the universe of types homeomorphic to $\set{R}$. The tautological bundle $\text{taut}^1: \set{RP}^1 \rightarrow \U_{\set{R}}$ is defined by the constructors $\set{I}$ maps to the path between $\set{R}$ and itself given by $\lambda x. x$, and $(\{0\} \times \set{I})$ maps to the path given by the automorphism $\lambda x . -x$.

From here, we proceed inductively. $\set{RP}^n$ is defined as the following pushout.\\
\[\begin{tikzcd}
\set{S}^{n-1} \times \set{I} \arrow[r, hook, "a_n"] \arrow[d, hook, "b_n" ] &\set{D}^{n} \arrow[d]\\
\text{taut}^{n-1} \arrow[r] &\set{RP}^n\\
\end{tikzcd}
\] where $a_n$ and $b_n$ are both inclusions of $\set{S}^{n-1} \times \set{I} $ as thickened boundary of $\text{taut}^{n-1}$ and $\set{D}^{n}$. The tautological bundle $\text{taut}^n: \set{RP}^n \rightarrow \U_{\set{R}}$ is defined by the constructors

\section{Cohomology}
\label{sec:cohom}

OUTLINE:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
  \textbf{Subsection 1.} 
  Define cohomology for $ \ZZtwo $ coefficients and the
  EM-spaces for $ \RRP^n $
\item
  \textbf{Subsection 2.} Show that we get a commutative
  graded ring structure for cohomology of any type $ \X $
  with $ \ZZtwo $-coefficients. Follow Brunerie's thesis.
\item
  \textbf{Subsection 3.} Compute $ \ZZtwo $-cohomology ring
  for $ \RRP^n $ using Mayer-Vietoris.  This needs us to
  first compute cohomology for disks and spheres.  
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Cohomology and EM-spaces for $\RRP^n$}


We follow a similar construction for cohomology as found in \cite{brunerie:thesis}, modifying their construction with $\ZZ$ coefficients to have coefficients in $\ZZtwo$. In order to define cohomology, we must first define Eilenberg-MacLane spaces $\KZtwo{n}$. Eilenberg-MacLane spaces $K(G,n)$ were defined for arbitrary group $G$ by Finster and Licata in \cite{fl:em}.

We give a construction of $\RRP^n$ in Section \ref{sec:rpn}, which shows that $\RRP^2$ will have the homotopy groups necessary to be the foundation of our Eilenberg-Maclane spaces. 
\begin{proposition}\label{prop:rpnhtpygps} %update this label when sec:rpn is done
	\[ \pi_k(\RRP^2)=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 0 & \text{for }n=0\\
	\ZZtwo & \text{for } n=1\\
	0 & \text{for } n> 1, 
	\end{array}\right.\]
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	\Amelia{We discussed this on Oct 1 2019 and thought this would go in Chandrika's section}
\end{proof}


\begin{definition}
	For $n:\NN$, the type \defn{Eilenberg-MacLane space} $\KZtwo{n}$ is the $n$-truncated and $(n-1)$-connected pointed type defined by
	\[ \KZtwo{n}:=\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \ZZtwo & \text{for }n=0\\
	\trunc{\Sigma^{n-1}\RRP^2}_n & \text{for } n\ge 1, 
	\end{array}\right.\]
	where $\Sigma^{n-1}$ indicates the reduced suspension $n-1$ times. 
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
	This definition of $\KZtwo{n}$ does indeed define an Eilenberg-Maclane Space. 
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	\Amelia{This is Prop \ref{prop:rpnhtpygps} and the fact (that I don't have a HoTT reference for) that EM spaces are unique.}
\end{proof}

\Amelia{Finster and Licata constructed $K(G,1)$ in a particular way. My concern is that I am not sure how that impacts which of their results transfer over. I think that their results in section 4 and 5 mean that as long as the $K(G,1)$ has the right groups, using suspension and truncation works. In which case, it doesn't matter that we constructed $K(G,1)$ differently than they did, their results should all port over. I'd really like a second opinion on this. }

\Amelia{G showed equivalence of $K_n$ and $\Omega K_{n+1}$. I don't think that's necessary given Finster and Licata.}

Given this construction of the EM spaces, we define cohomology in the following way. 

\begin{definition}
	For a type $\X$ and $n:N$, the \defn{$n$-th cohomology group of $\X$} is the type
	\[H^n(\X;\ZZtwo):= \trunc{\X\rightarrow \KZtwo{n}}_0.\] 
\end{definition}
\Amelia{B also defines reduced cohomology as well, not i'm not sure we need that. G proved a reduced MV sequence, so we may need it if we also use MV}



\subsection{Commutative Graded Ring Structure}



 Our strategy for describing the graded ring structure is to show that $||K(R,n)\wedge K(R,m)||_{n+m} = K(R\otimes R, n+m).$, then  lift the ring multiplication of $R \otimes R \to R$ to a cup product on cohomology with $R$-coefficient.s


\Amelia{ basically copy paste from ``Notes''. I'll keep working through this.}

\begin{proposition}
	$ \trunc{K(R,n) \wedge K(R,m)}_{n+m} = K(R \otimes R, n+m)$
\end{proposition} 

\begin{proof}
	We use the fact that $K(R \otimes R, n+m)$ is the unique up to homotopy space
	having the property that
	\[
	\pi_k (K(R \otimes R, n+m )) =
	\begin{cases}
	0, & k \neq n+m \\
	R \otimes R, & k= n+m \\
	\end{cases}
	\]
	Thus by showing that $ || K(R,n) \wedge K(R,m) ||_{n+m} $
	has the property, we have the desired
	equivalence. First, (see [Strom, Prop 19.60]) we have that
	\[
	\pi_{n+m} ( || K(R,n) \wedge K(R,m) ||_{n+m} )
	= R \otimes R.
	\]
	Second, we have that
	\[
	\pi_k ( || K(R,n) \wedge K(R,m) ||_{n+m} )
	= 0
	\]
	for $ k > n+m $ because $ || K(R,n) \wedge K(R,m) ||_{n+m} $
	is an $ ( n+m ) $-type. Third, we have that 
	\[
	\pi_k (|| K(R,n) \wedge K(R,m) ||_{n+m} ) = 0
	\]
	for $ k \leq n+m-1 $ because
	$ || K(R,n) \wedge K(R,m) ||_{n+m} $ is
	$ ( n+m-1 ) $-connected, which follows from $ K( R,k ) $ being
	$ ( k-1 ) $-connected, as seen in Guillame's
	thesis Prop 4.3.1. From these three facts, we conclude that
	\[
	\pi_k (|| K(R,n) \wedge K(R,m) ||_{n+m}) =
	\begin{cases}
	0, & k \neq n+m \\
	R \otimes R, & k= n+m \\
	\end{cases}
	\]
	and, in particular, we get that
	\[
	|| K(R,n) \wedge K(R,m) ||_{n+m} \simeq
	K (R \otimes R, n+m ).
	\]
	Evoking the univalence axiom, we get that
	\[
	|| K(R,n) \wedge K(R,m) ||_{n+m} =
	K (R \otimes R, n+m ).
	\]
\end{proof}

Now, we construct the ring structure on cohomology. The
strategy is to define structures and property on EM-spaces
then lift those up to cohomology. We defined our EM-spaces above.


To simplify the notation, we write $ K_n $ for
$ K( \ZZtwo,n) $ when feeling lazy.  Addition and subtraction
operations of type $ K_n \times K_n \to K_n $ follow
directly from Guillaume's thesis Proposition 5.1.4. Let's do
multiplication. From the multiplication
$ \ZZtwo \otimes \ZZtwo \to \ZZtwo $, we get a multiplication
$ K(\ZZtwo \otimes \ZZtwo, n)\to K(\ZZtwo, n) $ by applying the
functor
\[
K(-,n) \from \mathbf{Ring} \to \mathbf{Ho}(\mathbf{Top_\ast})
\]
But
\[
|| K(R,n) \wedge K(R,m) ||_{n+m} =
K (R \otimes R, n+m ).
\]
for any ring $ R $ as we showed above, and so we can treat our multiplication as
\[
\widehat{\mu} \from
|| K(\ZZtwo,n) \wedge K(\ZZtwo,m) ||_{n+m} \to K(\ZZtwo, n+m).
\]
However, we \emph{really} want the domain of multiplication
to be $ K ( \ZZtwo , n) \times K( \ZZtwo, m) $. To get this, we
precompose $ \widehat{\mu} $ by several canonical arrows
resulting in the composite
\[
K (\ZZtwo , n) \times K(\ZZtwo, m)
\xrightarrow{\mathtt{proj}}
K (\ZZtwo , n) \wedge K(\ZZtwo, m)
\xrightarrow{|-|_{n+m}}
|| K (\ZZtwo , n) \wedge K(\ZZtwo, m) ||_{n+m}
\xrightarrow{\widehat{\mu}}
K(\ZZtwo, n+m)
\]
that we call \emph{multiplication} $ \mu $.  This induces
the cup product
\[
\smile \from H^n(X) \times H^m(X) \to H^{n+m}(X)
\]
on cohomology. Recall that we define the $ n $-th cohomology
with $ \ZZtwo $-coefficients to be
$ H^n (X) \coloneqq || X \to_\ast K_n ||_0 $. This is the
standard definition in homotopy type theory, we do not use
singular cochains, because taking the set up cochains is not
a continuous process. Define
$ \smile ( |\alpha|, |\beta|) ) $, for
$ \alpha \from X \to_\ast K_n $ and
$ \beta ]from X \to K_m $, to be the truncation of the
pairing $ \langle \alpha, \beta \rangle $ followed by $ \mu $:
\[
\smile ( |\alpha|, |\beta|) ) :
|| X \to K_n \times K_m \to K_{n+m} ||_0.
\]
Thus $ \smile ( |\alpha|, |\beta|) ) $ type-checks. It
remains to show the usual ring properties hold for $ H^n(X)
$.  Distributivity follows directly from Guillaume's
argument in Proposition 5.1.7 which uses only connectivity
hence carries through to our context without issue.  To show
'graded comutativity', it suffices to show standard
comutativity because of the $ \ZZtwo $-coefficients.
